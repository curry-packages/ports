ports: Distributed programming with ports
=========================================

This package contains the library `Netowrk.Ports`
for distributed programming with ports.
In contrast to similar concepts in other languages,
this library allows sending logic variables over ports
which can be used as back channels.

The ideas behind this library are described in:

    Michael Hanus:
    Distributed Programming in a Multi-Paradigm Declarative Language
    In Proc. PPDP'99, Springer LNCS 1702, pp. 188-205, 1999

The `examples` directory contains some examples for using
this library.

Usage:

If the environment variable `TRACEPORTS` is set to `yes`,
some information about the port communication is traced
on stderr.
